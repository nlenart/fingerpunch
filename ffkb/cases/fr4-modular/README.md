# ffkb fr4 modular plates

These are untested. They should be fine, as they are based on the PCB layout, but use at your own risk!

## Instructions

Use Kicad to generate the gerbers for the switchplate-template and the bottomplate.

### Bottom plate

For the bottom plate, it requires no modifications. The only optional change you can make is to remove the 6 breakout tabs to make the last columns more rigid. With the breakout tabs, they will be subject to breaking easily.

### Switchplate

The same thing applies to the switchplate as does the bottom plate regarding the breakout tabs.

Also, there are footprints to cutout for the EC11 encoders and the EVQ encoders. You can remove one or both of those if you do not intend on using those in your build.
