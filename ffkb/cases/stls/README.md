# ffkb cases

I take no liability if these don't work as intended. I personally use them for the 3D printed cases on the website. I recheck them every time before I print, so I cannot ensure that they are perfect in their current state in this repository.

# v1

## center-covers

These are the center covers for the v1 high profile case. You print these and glue them once you've fully assembled the case.

# v2

These are the most commonly used cases for the low pro and high pro options as of now (2022-Aug)

# v3

This is a work in progress, and contains the cases for the trackball version of the ffkb v3
