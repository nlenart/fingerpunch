# Build guide

Notes:
* Solder the TRRS after the controller. It's very hard to reach the top pins of the xiao if you don't
* If you have a prototype ximi, solder the top of the O key diode to another diode in the row (include picture)
* If you have a prototype ximi, and you want to use per key leds, solder the L key ground pin to any other ground pin (include picture)
* If using a trackball, you cannot use audio or per key leds. As a matter of fact, you'll need to desolder the audio buzzer (include picture)
* Flash the controller the first time before you put it in the case. For whatever reason, the reset switch at the bottom of the pcb doesn't work the first time you flash the controller. You do this by holding the right button on the top side of the xiao, and then pressing the left one.
* If using a trackball, remember that you'll need to flip the wires (include picture)
* Soldering the 3 way thumbswitch is tricky. Solder the back 3 pads first, then the side two. This keeps it in place while you move the rocker to one side to give you the room to solder the sides. Alternatively, you can cut the black plastic a bit shorter to give you the space to do it.
