# v3 first release encoder fix

This fix is very straight forward. It only applies to the right encoder. Solder the leg of the encoder closest to the bottom of the board to the B4 pin marked on the pcb. Be sure that the encoder leg and the wire don't touch the corresponding through hole on the pcb. This will short to one of the legs of the left encoder, and cause the behavior to be erratic.

So, make sure the wire doesn't short to anything else, and it should work perfectly!
