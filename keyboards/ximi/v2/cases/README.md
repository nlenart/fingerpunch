# ximi v2

Please note that all ximi v1 cases are compatible with ximi v2, but not the other way around. All cases in this directory rely on VIK modules that aren't functional on ximi v1, which is why they exist here. Newly developed ximi v2 cases that are compatible with ximi v1 will be put in the ximi v1 directory.
