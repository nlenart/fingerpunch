# Pinkies Out 3D printable case

The filenames are fairly self explanatory. You should print a body and a bottom plate. If you are using an OLED, print an oled cover as well.

Some notes about these files:
* bottomplate versus bottomplate-inner: The regular bottom plate edges rest on the edge of the body, while the inner version actually goes inside the case body. If you have room inside the case after mounting your MCU, you can use the inner bottom plate to reduce the overall height of the keyboard by a couple of millimeters.
* oled-cover: you can experiment with these, but I found that the 3.5 or 4mm version works well for choc boards, and the 2mm version works well for MX. The reason for this is that the pcb sits closer to the top switchplate on a choc board, so the OLED sits a little bit higher. In an MX board, it sits a bit lower, so you can use the shorter OLED cover for that.
