# ximega

## overview

First and foremost, please note that all files are for the left half, and can be mirrored to make the right half. At the time of this writing, the exceptions to this are the cirque trackpad covers, since the mounting for the cirque is asymmetrical. For that cover, you'll notice there is a `left` and `right` version of the cover.  

To mirror a file, there are a variety of ways to do this:
* Mirror in your slicer before printing
* Import into a 3D modeling tool and mirror it
* Use an online tool to mirror the stl ( example: https://stl-mirror.beekeeb.com/ )

## parts for printing

To make a case for ximega, you'll need a minimum of 6 pieces:
* `ximega-base.stl` - left and right base, which are universal for MX or choc/glp (gateron low profile)
* `ximega-mx-switchplate.stl` or `ximega-choc-glp-switchplate.stl` - left and right switchplates
* An appropriate cover - There are `mx` and `choc-glp` versions of all covers, and there are different covers for the various VIK modules that you may be using. You'll need to select one for each half and print.

Note that the parts are testing using FDM 3D printing. Tolerances may vary depending on printing approach or materials used.

## parts for assembly

You'll need the following parts to assemble your board:
* 10-16 M2 heat set inserts, should be 3.6mm diameter and 3.5-4mm depth. You should use 5 per half, but if you want to really tightly secure the top cover to the body, you can use up to 8 per half.
* 10-16 M2 screws, 6mm length
* If you are using a VIK module, you may need 2-4 more heat set insert and screws per half. These are used to mount the VIK module PCB to the top cover
