(2022-08-30) These have *not* been tested, at all... please confirm them before fabricating.

Some notes:
* The EVQ version cut out may be a bit too narrow, so check that
* The switch hole cutouts are 13.8mm, and they should be 14.0mm. So you will want to expand those to 14.0mm. You can do this by extending each end of each line by 0.1mm on every switch cutout (tedious, but would fix the issue)
