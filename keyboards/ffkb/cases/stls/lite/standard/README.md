# ffkb lite case

If you're doing a wireless build, keep the following in mind for the bottom plate selection:

* `ffkb-lite-6-wireless-4.2mm-battery-bot.stl` - This fits a 4.2mm thick battery underneath the pcb, even with hotswap sockets in place. With this, you can get a very large battery, as long as it fits in the case dimensions as a whole, up to 4.2mm thick. In the center where there are no hotswap sockets it will fit a battery up to 6mm thick. Please double check the dimensions (length and width) if it's greater than 4.2mm thick.
* `ffkb-lite-6-wireless-bot.stl` - This one will give you up to 3.2mm thick if you have hotswap sockets for any length and width, as long as it fits in the case dimensions as a whole. If the battery is small enough to fit in the center where there are no hotswap sockets, it gives you up room for a battery up to 4mm thick. Please double check the dimensions (length and width) if it's greater than 3.2mm thick.
