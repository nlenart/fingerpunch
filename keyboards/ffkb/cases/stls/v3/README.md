# ffkb v3 case (made for the trackball)

## high profile

For this case, you will need to print a few things:
* 1x - The case body
* 1x - Bottom plate
* 1x - The trackball housing (if you use the modular case)
* 1x - The trackball cover
* 3x - BTU 4mm ball housing

Note: For the BTU 4mm ball housing, you can buy these instead. My model is designed for these: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256802880089745.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.0.0.187d18028Js9tO

For assembly materials, you will need:
* 8x M2 standoffs, 8mm
* 16x M2 screws, 4mm or 5mm
* 3x 4mm steel or nylon balls (included in the trackball kit)
* 34mm trackball

### case body and bottom plate

For the case body, you can choose to make a modular case, or a case with the built in BTU trackball housing.

The file format is:
ff-h2-{5|6}-tr-{ne|ec|ev}-{BTU|modular}.stl

* 5|6 - number of columns (as of this writing, only 6 column support)
* ne|ec|ev - no encoders, ec11, or evq roller encoders
* BTU|modular - BTU trackball housing built in, or modular to support future features

For the bottom plate, you can use the ffkb v2 high pro case bottom plate (5 or 6 column)

### trackball housing

If you use the modular, you will also need to print the trackball-housing.stl in the trackball directory

### trackball cover

Print btu-4mm-ball-housing.stl

### BTU 4mm ball housing

Print btu-4mm-ball-housing.stl in the trackball directory


## Assembly

1) With the BTU 4mm ball housing or the purchased BTU into the trackball housing. It will require a bit of force, but it's a press fit and should not come out.
2) Screw the standoffs into the top body
3) Put the fully assembled PCB into the case through the standoffs, with the switches and keycaps
4) If using the printed BTU 4mm ball housing, place the 4mm balls into the holes. Note that this is a loose fit, so you need to place them carefully. They will readily fall out if you tilt the case
5) Place the 34mm trackball on top. Once it is placed on top, the 4mm balls will not fall out
6) Compress the trackball cover a bit and slide in place in the center. There are notches in the cover, and grooves in the case. It should snap into place very securely.
7) Plug in the keyboard and test everything
8) Screw in the bottom plate
